\title{The Gene List of Cancer Single-cell State Atlas (CancerSEA)}
\format{
list
a gene symbol list with gene signature names collected in CancerSEA:
\describe{
\item{Angiogenesis}{Angiogenesis ensures that cancer cells receive continuous supplies
of oxygen and other nutrients.}
\item{Apoptosis}{The inactivation of apoptosis in cancer cells lead to the persistence
of such grossly abnormal cells in the tissues.}
\item{Cell Cycle}{Cell cycle,a critical process to ensure correct cell division,lies
at the heart of cancer.}
\item{Differentiation}{The degree of cell differentiation can be used to measure the
progress of cancer,and dedifferentiated cells can lead to the formation of cancer.}
\item{DNA damage}{DNA damage is an alteration in the chemical structure of DNA, and
un-repaired DNA damages accumulate in replicating cells possibly contribute to
progression to cancer.}
\item{DNA repair}{DNA repair plays a fundamental role in the maintenance of genomic
integrity,it's deficits may lead to carcinogenesis.}
\item{EMT}{EMT has been indicated to be involved in the initiation of metastasis in
cancer progression and in acquiring drug resistance.}
\item{Hypoxia}{Tumor-hypoxia contributes to cell mobility,metastasis and therapy resistance.}
\item{Inflammation}{Chronic inflammation can cause about 15\% to 25\% of human cancers.}
\item{Invasion}{Invasion is a critical carcinogenic event in which cancer cells escape
from their primary sites and spread to blood or lymphatic vessels.}
\item{Metastasis}{Metastasis promotes the malignant transformation of cancer and causes
most cancer deaths.}
\item{Proliferation}{Proliferation,as one of the cancer hallmarks,is responsible for tumor
progression.}
\item{Quiescence}{Quiescent cancer cells are resistant to chemotherapy.}
\item{Stemness}{Cancer cells with high stemness fuel the growth of cancer.}

\description{
CancerSEA is the first dedicated database that aims to
comprehensively decode distinct functional states of cancer cells at
single-cell resolution.
CancerSEASymbol is a gene symbol list, and CancerSEAEnsemble is a Ensemble
gene list, they are a list contained gene signature names collected in the database.

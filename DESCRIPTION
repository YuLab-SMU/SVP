Description: SVP uses the KNN Graph and random walk with restrat based on the space of 
  MCA to calculate the activity of gene sets (such as kegg pathway, signatures, go term, 
  gene modules, ...) efficiently. Then to detect the spatially or single cell variable 
  gene sets or (other features) with avoiding the lost of low activity score of gene sets
  or other features (such as the expression of genes), SVP uses the 2D Weighted Kernel 
  Density Estimation to process the score of gene sets (or expression of genes) and uses
  Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence to identify the signal features.

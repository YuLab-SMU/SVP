Description: SVP uses the distance between cells and cells, features and features, cells and 
  features in the space of MCA to build nearest neighbor graph, then uses random walk with 
  restart algorithm to calculate the activity score of gene sets (such as kegg pathway, signatures, 
  go term, gene modules, transcription factor, ...), which is then further weighted using the 
  hypergeometric test results from the original expression matrix. In addition, to detect the 
  spatially or single cell variable gene sets or (other features) accurately, SVP uses the 2d weighted
  kernel density estimation to process the score of gene sets (or expression of genes) and uses 
  Kullback–Leibler divergence to identify the spatial variable features based on permutation test. 
  SVP also provides Geary’s and Morans'I that measure spatial autocorrelation to identify the spatial 
  variable features efficiently based on Rcpp and RcppParallel. SVP is developed based on SingleCellExperiment 
  class, which can be interoperable with the existing computing ecosystem.
